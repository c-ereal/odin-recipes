        <b><i>Directions</i></b>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees fareinheit</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Add lasagna noodles and cook for 10 minutes or until 
                al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place ground beef, garlic, oregano, garlic 
                powder, salt, and black pepper in a large skillet over 
                medium heat; cook and stir until beef is crumbly and 
                evenly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and eggs together 
                in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Lay 4 noodles side by side on the bottom of a 9x13-inch 
                baking pan; top with a layer of prepared tomato-basil 
                sauce, a layer of ground beef mixture, and a layer of 
                cottage cheese mixture. Repeat layers twice more, ending 
                with a layer of sauce; sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
                 Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the lasagna is bubbling 
                and the cheese has melted, about 30 minutes. Remove foil 
                and bake until cheese has begun to brown, about 10 more 
                minutes. Allow to stand at least 10 minutes before 
                serving.</li>
        </ol>
